          <h2>Hellooo Everyone! My name is Leila Teixeira</h2>
          <h3>
            Diving into the digital realm is my thing!<br></br> With a knack for crafting
            experiences, I have poured my creativity into UX/UI design, ensuring
            users feel understood and appreciated when navigating the digital world.<br></br>
            But wait, there is more! <br></br>Not only do I design these experiences, I bring
            them to life as a Web Developer. Pixels, codes, designs, or animations,
            you name it, I have played with it. So, whether you are looking for a
            sleek design, efficient code, or just want to geek out about the latest
            web trends, I am your go-to person.{" "}
